What is Upala
=============

**Greetings human!** 

.. Upala is here to help you spot bots!

Upala at a glance
=================

Upala is an anti-Sybil system for DApps and a decentralized digital identity.

- Provides a digital identity uniqueness score in dollars (Price of forgery).
- Utilizes the social responsibility concept ("Invite only trusted members, or lose your money and reputation").
- Hierarchical social graph. Built with groups. Stored on-chain.
- Simple off-chain graph analysis and on-chain proofs.
- Upala is a protocol. It enables to build different identity systems united under the same scoring standard.
- The protocol can wrap over existing systems (Bright ID, Humanity DAO, Idena) and unite them.

Price of forgery
================

Upala provides a **digital identity uniqueness score**. The score is valued in dollars and represents the explosion price - an amount of money that an identity holder can get at any time for deleting their ID. The higher the explosion price the higher the owner values the ID and the safer it is for DApps to interact with.

The building block of Upala social graph is a group. The explosions payouts are provided by groups pools. Thus groups tend to consist of people who believe that other members value their IDs equally.

Groups may earn by providing user scores to dapps and/or from user deposits and are incentivized to gather as many users as possible. Users are incentivized to choose groups giving the highest scores. At the same time the higher the explosion price (the score), the higher is the incentive to forge an identity. The market drives these prices to the equilibrium for every user (much in the same way as insurance rates balance).

.. The harder it is to gain such score again, the harder it is to forge - thus the Price of forgery. 

.. Price of personhood
.. Price-of-personhood digital identity.

.. 
	This is the price of getting an identity again. If you cheat your friends and steal money from them. You'd have to repay the debt or find other friends. Build trust there. Those with little trust are risky. They need to pay more.
	
	This is 

	The state ID has a price too. You can forge it, use it and discard. There is a price of trust. 

	The rest trust is built with reputation.

The Protocol and the Universe
=============================

**Upala is a protocol and everything built with it.** 

Rather than building a single system, we developed a digital identity scoring protocol. We use the protocol to build a family of unique identity systems, wrap around existing ones and provide tools for other developers to build their own unique identity solutions. The protocol **unites different identity systems under the same scoring standard**.

The main idea of the protocol is the notion of bot reward. It is an amount of money that any user can run away with. The money is collected by all participants. So everybody is incentivized to allow only trusted members. The bot reward is a **kind of stake**. It signals the quality of a participant. 

Users join groups. Groups join larger groups (groups of groups). Larger groups join even larger groups. And so on. This creates a hierarchy with massive groups at the top and users at the bottom. DApps can request users' scores from any group. 


.. The protocol utilizes social responsibility concept. 
.. how it works. Shared (social) responsibility. Within a group One has to invite only trusted members. Otherwise a neighbour may explode. The same applies for groups. If a group joins a superior group it means it trusts all other groups in it.

.. Groups and explosive bots. Groups form hierarchy based on trust. any group can show a user score relative to that group. And most importantly an Upala group shows price for which a user can immediately sell their identity. This price and the amount of users united by the group signals the group quality.

**The Upala protocol** (:ref:`Explosive bots protocol<bots>`) is a simple incentive layer that helps build different identity systems. It also helps to unite Upala-native identity systems and existing ones (by wrapping Upala around them) under the same identity standard.

**Upala Universe** is everything built on top of or wrapped with the Upala Protocol.


Design philosophy
=================

- Protect bots rights
- Everything which is not forbidden is allowed
- Crypto-economic constrains instead of code constrains
