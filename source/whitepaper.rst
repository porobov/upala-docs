What is Upala

**Greetings human!**


Upala proof of uniqueness
=========================
Upala is a proof of uniqueness system. One person — one ID.

The protocol and the Universe
=============================

Upala is a protocol and everything built with it. 

**The Upala protocol** (:ref:`Explosive bots protocol<bots>`) is a simple incentives layer protocol that helps build different identity systems. It also helps to unite Upala native systems as well as existing identity systems (by wrapping Upala around them) under the same identity standard.

**Upala Universe** (:ref:`link<universe>`) is everything built on top of or wrapped with the Upala Protocol.


Design philosophy
=================

- Protect bots rights
- Everything which is not forbidden is allowed
- Cryptoeconomic constrains instead of code constrains


**Sorry, human, the rest of the page is under construction.** More info soon. For now, have a look at :ref:`how Upala works<bots>`.

	What is Upala
	-------------
	
	Upala is here to help us spot bots among us! 

	We often refer to Upala as a digital identity system. But there are a myriad of them in the wild. The following is the explanation of Upala unique position among other systems. 

	What Upala isn't
	----------------
	**Upala is not (just) an identity storage solution**
	**Upala is not a hypothetic ideal digital identity**

	Upala is a personhood scoring system
	------------------------------------
	The system answers the question - how likely (in percent) this entity (address) is a real human. A more detailed question is here (todo - The real question is  )
	 ... which is theoretically could be even better than an issued identity (explained here todo)
	Game-based blockchain-powered personhood scoring system. Helps to distinguish humans from bots.

	The same goal as CAPTCHA.

	First, we distinguish identity storage solutions and


	There are still a set of personhood scoring system in the blockchain space. Here 

	Upala is a standard and a set of different identity systems united by the standard.

	Upala is a Game-based blockchain-powered personhood scoring system
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	It just happens so that blockchain is the perfect solution to use as a platform to build Upala on. Upala is blockchain agnostic. It is a game which can be powered by almost any blockchain supporting smart contracts.

	Issued identity
	Defacto ID
	Self-asserted ID
	Disclosure on demand. Decide which pieces of information to share.
	Friends recover each other's accounts.
