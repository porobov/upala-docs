What is Upala
=============

**Greetings human!** 

.. Upala is here to help you spot bots!

Upala at a glance
=================

- Provides a digital identity uniqueness score. In dollars (Price of Person-hood).
- Utilizes the social responsibility concept ("Invite only trusted members, or lose your money and reputation").
- Hierarchical social graph. Built with groups. Stored on-chain.
- Simple off-chain graph analysis and on-chain proofs.
- Upala is a protocol. It enables to build different identity systems united under the same scoring standard. 
- The protocol can wrap over existing systems (Bright ID, Humanity DAO, Idena) and unite them.

Upala provides a **digital identity uniqueness score**. The score is represented by a price for which an identity can be sold at any time. The higher the price the more the ID owner values it, the safer it is to interact with.

.. 
	This is the price of getting an identity again. If you cheat your friends and steal money from them. You'd have to repay the debt or find other friends. Build trust there. Those with little trust are risky. They need to pay more.
	
	This is 

	The state ID has a price too. You can forge it, use it and discard. There is a price of trust. 

	The rest trust is built with reputation.

The Protocol and the Universe
=============================

**Upala is a protocol and everything built with it.** 

Rather than building a single system, we developed a digital identity scoring protocol. We use the protocol to build a family of unique identity systems, wrap around existing ones and provide tools for other developers to build their own unique identity solutions. The protocol **unites different identity systems under the same scoring standard**.

The main idea of the protocol is the notion of bot reward. It is an amount of money that any user can run away with. The money is collected by all participants. So everybody is incentivized to allow only trusted members. The bot reward is a **kind of stake**. It signals the quality of a participant. 

Users join groups. Groups join larger groups (groups of groups). Larger groups join even larger groups. And so on. This creates a hierarchy with massive groups at the top and users at the bottom. DApps can request users' scores from any group. 


.. The protocol utilizes social responsibility concept. 
.. how it works. Shared (social) responsibility. Within a group One has to invite only trusted members. Otherwise a neighbour may explode. The same applies for groups. If a group joins a superior group it means it trusts all other groups in it.

.. Groups and explosive bots. Groups form hierarchy based on trust. any group can show a user score relative to that group. And most importantly an Upala group shows price for which a user can immediately sell their identity. This price and the amount of users united by the group signals the group quality.

**The Upala protocol** (:ref:`Explosive bots protocol<bots>`) is a simple incentive layer that helps build different identity systems. It also helps to unite Upala-native identity systems and existing ones (by wrapping Upala around them) under the same identity standard.

**Upala Universe** is everything built on top of or wrapped with the Upala Protocol.


Design philosophy
=================

- Protect bots rights
- Everything which is not forbidden is allowed
- Crypto-economic constrains instead of code constrains

Roadmap
=======

- Draft 2-3 digital identity systems using Upala protocol
- Finalize the protocol
- Build an MVP digital identity system on top of the protocol
- Build another digital identity system and unite it with the MVP
- Provide tools for creating Upala-compliant identity systems


**Next, human, have a look at** :ref:`how Upala works<bots>`.

.. The following is the explanation of Upala unique position among other digital identity systems.
