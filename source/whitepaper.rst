What is Upala
=============

**Greetings human!** 

.. Upala is here to help you spot bots!

Upala provides a **digital identity uniqueness score**. The score is represented by a price for which an identity can be sold at any time. The higher the price the more the ID owner values it, the safer it is to interact with.


The Protocol and the Universe
=============================

Upala is a protocol and everything built with it. 

Rather than building a single system, we developed a digital identity scoring protocol. We use the protocol to build a family of unique identity systems, wrap around existing ones and provide tools for other developers to build their own unique identity solutions. The protocol unites different identity systems under the same scoring standard.

.. The protocol is built around idea of explosive bots. The explosion is made in expense of others. So everyone is incentivized to allow only trusted members to their groups 

.. The protocol utilizes social responsibility concept. 
.. how it works. Shared (social) responsibility. Within a group One has to invite only trusted members. Otherwise a neighbour may explode. The same applies for groups. If a group joins a superior group it means it trusts all other groups in it.

.. Groups and explosive bots. Groups form hierarchy based on trust. any group can show a user score relative to that group. And most importantly an Upala group shows price for which a user can immediately sell their identity. This price and the amount of users united by the group signals the group quality.

**The Upala protocol** (:ref:`Explosive bots protocol<bots>`) is a simple incentive layer that helps build different identity systems. It also helps to unite Upala-native identity systems and existing ones (by wrapping Upala around them) under the same identity standard.

**Upala Universe** is everything built on top of or wrapped with the Upala Protocol.


Design philosophy
=================

- Protect bots rights
- Everything which is not forbidden is allowed
- Crypto-economic constrains instead of code constrains


Next, human, have a look at :ref:`how Upala works<bots>`.

.. The following is the explanation of Upala unique position among other digital identity systems.
