Here is how it works:

Imagine someone created a bot army. They now have a choice to sell it or to explode and get an ammount of money corresponding to scores of the bots. For this botnet owner there is no sense to sell it for a price lower than the explosion price. At the same time at scale there is no possibility to sell for a price higher than explosion price, because someone else may drop the price close to explosion price. So the sell price tend to be roughly equal to explosion price (score). 

sell_price = score.

When a group starts to see explosions among its members. It has a choice either to lower their score, or strengthen its entry tests. So that applicatnts will have to put more efforts (e.g. more time on CAPTCHA, prove another social network profile, deposit more money) in order to get a score. Next time a maliciuos user wants to create a bot within this group it will be either harder to do or cheaper to sell. Both actions will make it less tempting for the malicious users.

But the same changes will make it less tempting for ordinary users as well. Existing users don't want their score to be lowered. New users have choice too. They will just chose a group with better score/efforts ratio.

So the best way for a group is not just make entry test harder, but make it harder for malicious users only. 

Maliciuos users select groups with the best score/forgery_efforts ratio. They want to earn so they are looking for groups where the score could compensate for the efforts spent and provide some income. 

score >= forgery_efforts + sell_price 

The groups where (score >> forgery_efforts + sell_price) will suffer to many bots and will either have to increase forgery_efforts or decrease score. Users will select groups wh

forgery_effots + sell_price = score

Groups will set their score as high as possible in order to attract people, but just below the forgery price, so that bots will stay away
    
Conclusion.

In this game the most effective human test wins. For any entry test the more the gap between efforts of a malicious user and a good one, the better. So it is harder only for a malicious users to enter. That is the price of forgery increases.
