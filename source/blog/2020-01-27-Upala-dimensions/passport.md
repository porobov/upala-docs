## User goes to an ofiice. 
## User signs a contract with the authority in the office (provider)
Using their passport they may arrange a sale contract or something similar. The idea is to sell digital identity score and get user passport data. 

## Provider stores user data into database...
Ok this should be at least country scale database in order to keep track of exploed passorts. We could store passport data in hashes. 

how we ensure that a provider will not generate a bot army? 

This is enforced legaly by a real-world contract.
