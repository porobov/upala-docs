Lets go down to details and try to combine 
Metacartel and Humanity DAO. 

Let's start even smaller. Let's bring identity to Metacartel and see how much members trust each other. 

Is there even sense to do so? 

If they added each other to the Cartel, they already trust each other. 

So, let's go a step up. 

# Why would they join at all? 
There are currently no benefits. Even Humanity DAO has UBI. I can try to engage them with advertising... But it is a totally new system. Not easy one. 

Let's assume people will join just for the fun of it. 


# What if I use DAO members as seeds? 
So they can earn inviting other members


# MVP
An experiment. Unite all the devs.
Need an external investor to see, who is gonna explode first.


Every DAO is a group. Copy all members and let "investors" pour money at the top. See who is gonna leave first.
