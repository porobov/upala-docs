Lets go down to details and try to combine 
Metacartel and Humanity DAO. 

Let's start even smaller. Let's bring identity to Metacartel and see how much members trust each other. 

Is there even sense to do so? 

If they added each other to the Cartel, they already trust each other. 

So, let's go a step up. 

# Why would they join at all? 
There are currently no benefits. Even Humanity DAO has UBI. I can try to engage them with advertising... But it is a totally new system. Not easy one. 

# What if I use DAO members as seeds? 
So they can earn inviting other members
