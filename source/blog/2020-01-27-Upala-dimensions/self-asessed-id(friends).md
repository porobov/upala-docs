A user puts a stake on theirself. 

By the way what is the difference of hvaing multiple groups or one large group for all? ... forget about it. 


# Staking yourself

If you stake yourself, you are eligible to get more bot reward. At the same time your are open to risks of bot attaks. If you are staking more money you either
1. Want a higher score AND you trust your peers 
2. or you want to get a higher bot reward (if protocol enables such a game)

Lets suppose the protocol restricts behavior like this.

The more I stake, the more reputable my account AND my group are. Makes sense. 

# Staking higher groups

Makes even more sense. But capital from the bottom will tend to give scores according to shares. The more I pay, the higher is my score.
