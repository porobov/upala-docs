# Price-of-personhood digital idenity

Before reading about the protocol I want you to tune in a bit into our thinking.

...In the long run identity is all about money (human accounting, mitigation of risks). Here is a question then: **what is the price of a state ID**?

## Issue price
One has to pay a comission to get a passport or to reissue it. So, there is a price to issue an ID. 

## Black market price
An identity could be stolen or forged. There are markets for stolen and forged identities. And there are prices for both.

## Market price
There are prices which reflect how valueable your ID is to a counterparty. For example an avarage threshold loan amount a credit organization is willing to give without any other inquiries than a valid ID. Or an avarage rate for renting a car (or maybe renting a car in a foreign country). These are risks. Due to market effectiveness these prices incorporate many interlinked parameters (like froging price, law enforcement effectiveness, etc.) and show the **market's trust to an ID issuer**.

## Repicant price
And at last there is a price which reflects how valueable your ID is to yourself. But we need to go a little forward into the future. 
What is a price of creating a realistic doll looking and behaving just like you and with the same credentials controlled by someone else (or something else, phew!)? And even a trickier question. What is the price for which you will let someone to contorl your avatar? This is yet another dimension to the state ID price.

So what is the price of a state ID? I don't have a good answer right now. If you do please share your ideas in the comments. By sharing these thoughts I  wanted to prepare the ground for price-of-personhood concept and hopefully discussion. Here are some things to bear in mind:
1. Identity can be priced.
2. There is no direct evaluation. The risks are outside of an identity system (one can rent a 100 cars a day and sell them). Market gives the best possible evaluation available.
3. There is no 100% Sybil-proof even in state ID systems.

Now to the protocol.

-------

**Tragedy of commons for bots (cannot coordinate) and trust brought on-chain for humans.**
**Anti-fragile system**


The real world game is too complex to give the price. 

Upala strips the identity price game to the essense.

## This is what we give - into the price of personhood section. 
We provide uniquness score in dollars - which is in the long run the forging price (th sell price of a user).

DApps can now define safe margin for their "deal" with a user. That is 
Ask a question will I airdrop $1 UBI to a group of users who price themselves at 1 dollar or a 100 dollars. 


And it provides 

Both prices are to be defined by free market. 



The price selling oneself is huge, but are not hoping to rent cars using ids from the start. Wwe can start small.  What if we start with a much cheaper price for idenity and encrease it later by bringing other "dimensions" to identity.

We cannot enforce. We can only offer. 


-----


The froging price defines the safe margin to interact with an ID. 

The value of a state ID is the law enforcement behind it and forgeproofness.

If one wants a bigger loan, they need to build reputation. 

One can lend a car and steal it. Or one can steal a 100 cars in one day. 

What benefits governments get? do they get. What is the value? 

----------
I'm a bit hesitant on the category. Maybe it is better suited to Applications. But this is more than application. As this is now a protocol and it provides Sybil-resistance. Maybe it could even be used as a part of consensys algorithm. Plus I had a courage form Kenneth to post in this category (thank you, Ken). 

I decided to follow Ken's advice (thank you for the courage).

We came up with an identy protocol design whih may be of interest.

I posted earlier here. Now we've come to a much more mature solution. 

If you are more comfortable with code (quite green though) have a look at our repo.






Upala's unique position among other digital identity systems. 

## Uniqueness 
Not a storage solution...

.. how much does it cost to forge a state ID (passport). 
.. from captcha to passport. Passport can be bought and sold too. But to what extent can we trust to a person with just a passport. In real world behavior and credibility is more important than identity. 

.. Quote "Social identity network of unique humans. allows people to prove to applications that they're only using one account."

## Uniqueness score
Dollars instead of percent. 

## Fully onchain
Everything is onchain 
No need in complex analysis. Deterministic score. 

## A protocol
Diveri

    The following is the explanation of Upala unique position among other digital identity systems. 
    
    What Upala isn't
    ----------------
    **Upala is not (just) an identity storage solution**
    **Upala is not a hypothetic ideal digital identity**


    Upala is a personhood scoring system
    ------------------------------------
    The system answers the question - how likely (in percent) this entity (address) is a real human. A more detailed question is here (todo - The real question is  )

     ... which is theoretically could be even better than an issued identity (explained here todo)
    Game-based blockchain-powered personhood scoring system. Helps to distinguish humans from bots.


    First, we distinguish identity storage solutions and


    Issued identity
    Defacto ID
    Self-asserted ID
    Disclosure on demand. Decide which pieces of information to share.
    Friends recover each other's accounts. 



# What is this price

The price represents how hard it is to get the same level of reputation again. If one sells thier ID, they'd have to get it again (if the system works). 



# We probably need to think of uniuqe entity problem 
AIs and devices will demand rights too.
