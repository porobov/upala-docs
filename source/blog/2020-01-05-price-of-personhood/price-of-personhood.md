Price of personhood


Upala's unique position among other digital identity systems. 

## Uniqueness 
Not a storage solution...

.. how much does it cost to forge a state ID (passport). 
.. from captcha to passport. Passport can be bought and sold too. But to what extent can we trust to a person with just a passport. In real world behavior and credibility is more important than identity. 

.. Quote "Social identity network of unique humans. allows people to prove to applications that they're only using one account."

## Uniqueness score
Dollars instead of percent. 

## Fully onchain
Everything is onchain 
No need in complex analysis. Deterministic score.

    The following is the explanation of Upala unique position among other digital identity systems. 
    
    What Upala isn't
    ----------------
    **Upala is not (just) an identity storage solution**
    **Upala is not a hypothetic ideal digital identity**


    Upala is a personhood scoring system
    ------------------------------------
    The system answers the question - how likely (in percent) this entity (address) is a real human. A more detailed question is here (todo - The real question is  )

     ... which is theoretically could be even better than an issued identity (explained here todo)
    Game-based blockchain-powered personhood scoring system. Helps to distinguish humans from bots.


    First, we distinguish identity storage solutions and


    Issued identity
    Defacto ID
    Self-asserted ID
    Disclosure on demand. Decide which pieces of information to share.
    Friends recover each other's accounts.
