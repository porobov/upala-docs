# Система инициатив. Репутацию меняем на взаимодействие.

At Upala we believe there is a way to make a decentralized identity system self-sustainable. We believe there is a way to do without an external source of money. There is so much of vaulue locked in knowing that every user in your database is unique! It makes sense to monetize this information. 

There are several ways we can imageine:
- The product is a blockchain (or a side chain). If you know that every node is a real person it can simplify staking or at least make it cheaper. Uniqueness is a byproduct here. It is free both for users and services. 
- The product is a bank. The idea is to create a finance system with social responsibility. Lenders and borrowers interact paying commission to the system. Inspired Microfinance ideas by Muhammad Yunus (https://www.forbes.com/sites/face-to-face/2010/04/16/muhammad-yunus-on-microfinance/#48a5ba25420f). Uniqueness is a byproduct here too.
- The most obvious product is the uniquness information itself. Here services buy proof of uniquness or users buy access to the plaform (or both parties pay). 

A blockchain and a bank solutions require a deterministicaly measured uniqueness probabiliy to build security assumtions. We cannot figure out yet how to do it. The best we can do now is provide a person's reputation score which is not probability. But it is a very tempting line of research.

Here I would like to give some ideas of how the third version may be built. We can do it by introducing two-token system. 

# Value generation. Reputation token. 
The value of the Upala system is generated when human uniquness is confirmed. In our random handshakes anti-sybil mechanism uniquness is confirmed when people meet each other in random pairs. They both gain reputation. Let's turn this reputation into Reputation token. 
 
There is a certain reputation threshold to be considered a human. When people start earning reputation above this level, they are working for the benefits of the system. They bring more people in, they reconfirm each other. This activity strengthens and heals the system and should be rewarded. 

    Reputation is earned for heling the system. Reputation is spent (burned) by a user when they are interacting with a service to prevent spamming.

So that they can sell their excess Reputation. 

But we cannot transfer or sell reputation. Someone would transfer it to bots. We need to sell it in some other form. We need another token, a transferable one.

# Value capture. Interaction token. 
The beneficiaries of the uniquenss system are all the people, of course. Nobody wants bots. But it is serices who is gonna get the most value of the uniqenss. It is them, who can earn more if their audience is of better quality. Wheter it is a social network, news or votig service they all want somebody to filter their bots out to provide a better service. So let's charge them. Services are the customers. Let's introduce Interaction token for them. 

    Interaction token is spent (burned) by a service when a user is interacting with a service.

# Exchange. Selling reputation.
Let's now allow the exchange of Reputation for Interaction.

    Anyone can convert their excess Reputation to Interaction and sell it to services through exchanges. No way to convert it back, no way to transfer Reputation. 

# Governance
We can also introduce governance model, which will require both Reputation and Interaction tokens to participate in decision making process.

# Conclusion
Services pay people for healing the network. Incentives are aligned. 

This incetive model is pluggable into any anti-sybil mechanism where users need to be rewarded for "healing" actions.
 


Can they afford it?
Will the Economy work?
How much value they get of a good uniqueness database. Expenses for their own antisybil. There are many companies. 

In the simplest scenario Reputation is the same as Interaction, except that it is locked.









Хиалеры получают избыток репутации. Они могут обменять репутацию на токены взаимодействия. Компании покупают эти токены. И эти же токены они отдают за репутацию, при взаимодействии с пользователями.

Чем больше репутации, тем больше взаимодействия. 

Репутация расходуется, чтобы ограничить возможности ботов. Нужно постоянно подтверждать, что ты человек. В идеале один раз в год. 

Как получить репутацию. Не обязательно по механизму рукопожатий. Она может быть propagated другими способами (друзья передают тем, кому доверяют).

При взаимодействии с сервисами репутация сжигается и токены взаимодействия тоже сжигаются. Так не будет спама. Это комиссия системы для юзеров и для сервисов. 

Ценность системе создает репутация (хилеры). Взаимодействие - то, как расходуется эта ценность. 

Репутацию невозможно передать. 

Взаимодействие - это таже репутация, только обменная. 

А есть еще цена за взаимодействие в долларах. 

Сервисы не должны платить пользователям. Сервисы должны платить системе.
