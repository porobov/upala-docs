# If you missed the previous post 

I'm developing a new identity proof system. It is based on six degrees of separation idea. The idea assumes that the whole world nows each other in just six handshakes. I want to put these connections on blockchain. 

It is a huge goal. To get there I decided to start a series of posts, showing my developement process. The first post was about my personal mission. Which is "move the world towards peace". As the previous post is devoted to very abstract things. 


# Intro

This is the second post. Here I would like to start going down to earth... Though still stay at high in abstract levels.

Embarrassingly enough I'm starting from a soultion. Not a goal, not a use case or a platform description. For now I only have this very abstract intuitive vision of how it should work. Through these posts (and hopefuly discussions) I hope to discover what it actualy is and what it is it for.

Ok. Now when all sceptics are gone. Here are my thoughts on the solution and further plan.


# Solution

Actualy if you already heard about six degrees of separation. You can ommit the following. The solution in short is just to bring six degrees of separation to blockchain and connect the whole world. The following is just a very approximate mathematical (I dare say that) proof of that the idea is quite sane. 

I want to prove to you that it will work. I'm not going to make complicated math. I'm enerpreneur. I'm alright with "it seems to work". 


# Subjective proof

In 2014 I went to enterpreneurs camp Seliger in Russia (I'm from Russia by the way). 

1. I presented my project to Russian Minister of Education (sorry, don't remember your name, minister) and shook his hand. 
2. He defenitely knows Putin (hope they shake hands too). 
3. ~~And Putin knows everybody in the world!~~ Putin presumably knows every other world leader. 

There are just 3 handshakes from me to any country in the world. Now there are 3 handshakes left for you to be "connected" to your president (king or queen or other leader) to know me. 

If you haven' had a chance to meet a minister it may seems unrealistic at first. But remember you can choose anybody you have ever met in your life and you got 1 handshake more than I had.

You probably have enterpreneurs, social activists, politicians among your friends, your parents friends or your employer's friends. If you think hard enough I'm sure you could find a 3 handshakes link to the president of your country. Even if you can't is still a very high chance that you know someone, who knows someone, who knows your president.

So you know me in just 6 handshakes. Nice to meet you!

We just proved that the idea works for the two of us.

    By the way Putin knows Vitalik Buterin. If you are Vitalik, mind that we know each other in just 3 handshakes! Do hope to reduce it to 1, man!


# Mathematical proof

Now let's now unite the whole world with some simple math. 

In 2019 there are 7,53 bln people in the world (todo link). 6 handshakes means 7 people. How many contacts should everyone have to cover the whole world? We need to raise 7,53 in power of 1/7: 

7,53^1/7 = 25,76147414

When dealing with people it is good practice to round to whole number

If I know 26 people and each of them knows 26 different people, than there are 26x26 = 26^2 = 676 people connected in 2 handshakes. For 6 six handshakes there are 26x26x26x26x26x26x26 = 26^7 = 8,031,810,176 = 8 bln people.

Have you met more than 26 different people in your life? I bet you did.

We can also experiment a bit with a number of handshakes. 
(1÷9) = 12,5
(1÷8) = 17,2
(1÷7) = 25,7
(1÷6) = 44,2
(1÷5) = 94,4
(1÷4) = 294,3
7500000000^(1÷3) 1957,4

This table looks reassuring too. 

Of course it is so oversimplified. And I know it is very easy to be mislead when dealing with big numbers. But still 26 seems to me very very small number. If you can prove that I'm wrong at least by a factor of 2, please let me know. Though I can't promiss it will stop me.


# Social proof

While editing this article I stumbled upon some more facts on six degrees of separation. In this article (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/03/internet.email) Microsoft confirms that the idea works with 6.6 handshakes. In this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=536&v=TcxZSmzPw8k) Facebook is said to confirm it is just 5 handshakes and Neil deGrasse Tyson says it is only 4.


# Plan 

It all seems to me doable. Especialy if we can figure out the right incentives. The rest is just what the blockchain technology is good for. 

The plan now is to do a lot of brainstorming and sort out the best ideas. The next posts will be devoted to these themes.

- Analyse existing identity systems
- Imagining the perfect picture. The the six handshakes project is a success. The world is connected. What it will look like? What kind of information can be pulled out of it? What's the use of knowing connections of all people in the world?
- How to build the perfect picture? What are the incetives? How to make it viral enough? 
- A roadmap. Can a roadmap be split into stages? Is there a MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?

=================================

As of now my nearest plan seems to my as brainstorming and then. Pealing away all the sheluha. 

Having a mission is cool, but it should be useful too. We need a platform definition, a goal, a roadmap, etc. But let it all leave to another post. I'm still at pretty high level of abstraction. 


Kind of funny but I realized I'm starting not from a goal but rather from solution. 

And go down from some mystic mission to more concrete things. You can't just build a project for mission. 

I feel kinda clumsy staring with solution. As the whole roject still sits in my head in some very abstract intuitive vision. I have to go through to it.
