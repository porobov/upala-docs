# Adoption gap

Earlier we outlined three major chalanges for a decentralized identification system:
- Sybil attack protection
- Account recovery mechanism
- Incentives

These are components that make the system work. But we assume that there is already enough people in the system. We assume that the system is already adopted. 

But adoption itself is a much harder challange which comes before the three. And it is the most important one. There is a critiacal mass of active users, needed for the system to function properly. Without this critical mass: 
- Algorithms won't work 
- Incetives won't work
- There is high level of centralization 
- There is no reason for a service (a custmoer) to integrate with the system
- There is no reason for new users to join

In order to fill the adoption gap we need to build something realy viral. We see three ways of fulfilling this goal:

__Huge benefits for services__
Create something so valuable for services (i.e. cunsumers of user uniqueness data), that they will force users to sign in exlusevely with our identification system. Social networks, staking and voting systems, many other existing services - they all need human uniquness. 

__Huge benefits for users__
Pay users directly, promise a huge return on investment, create a pyramid scheme. Thus create an asset first and add a utility second.

__Huge benefits for small communities__
Similar to the first one. Create something so valuable for a community (a community of gamers, a community of universal basic income receivers), that they will force other user to prove their uniqueness. 

These are all assume that there will be some limited functionality at the start. It is ok and it may work. Or probably the right incentives will solve adoption problem. But there is at least another approach we would like to consider. What if we try to provide a totaly different functionality? 

__Provide some other benefit__
If we cannot make identification system work at the start, let it be something different than identification system. Let's try to solve some immediate today's problem and deliver identification as a byproduct when the system is well adopted. 

I can see at least two paths of developement which can grow to an identification system in the future:
- A CAPTCHA system
- A password manager

I will devote one of the future posts to one of them. 

# Conclusionn
An identity system is useless without users. And there is no reason for a user to join a system which doesn't work. This vicious cycle is hard to break. It is escpecially painful for a blockchain project with its unbearable complexity for an average Internet 2.0 user. We will consider adoption thoroughly and try several paths.
