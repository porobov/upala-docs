Everything You Need to Know About Upala, All in One Place (Updated Regularly)

Last updated: May 30, 2019

Greetings human! Upala is here to help you to distinguish other humans from bots.

# About this document

We are developing an identity proof system Upala. Its purpose is to distinguish people from bots and clones (people with multiple IDs). One person — one ID. It is a huge goal. To get there we started a series of posts, showing our thinking process. We will then transform these posts into whitepaper.

This document is a summary of everything we've done so far. The document is meant to be short and easy to understand, with no technical details.

# Motivation (Why we do it)

__ID for the poor and the repressed__. There are 1,1 bln people in the world with no ID at all (http://blogs.worldbank.org/ic4d/counting-uncounted-11-billion-people-without-ids). It means they have no ability to protect their rights for education, job, property, banking services, etc. Then there are people living under authoritarian leadership. Anyone resisting the regime cannot be free (https://hackernoon.com/resistance-as-a-service-a6a9cd14192f). And finaly there are people living in extreme poverty. Universal basic income is almost here to help them, but it cannot be efficient without IDs. Decentralized identity is the question of peace. Make unique humans not war.
__A more reliable and private ID__. We believe it is possible to build a decentralized digital iedntity which is more reliable than any state issued ID. We believe there is a way to make it theft and fraud proof. And definetely there is a way to add better privacy to your identity.  
__ID for the Interntet__. We are creating IDs for humans, not bots. Fake accounts are evolving. We have to build an even faster evolving sytem to oppose them.

# Features

__Proof of uniqueness__. One person — one ID. An alternative to goverment issued ID. 
__Disclosure on demand__. Decide which pieces of information to share. 
__Friends recover each other’s accounts__. In blockchain your private key is your responsibility. We would like to share this responsibility with friends. So that there is a way to recover your account in a decentralized way. 


# Challenges

__Sybil attack protection__. How to prevent malicious actors (individuals, groups) from creating multiple accounts?
__Account recovery__. Mnemonics are too complex, hardware tokens are rare and expensive. How to build a secure system for the unskilled, the absent-minded and the naive?
__Incentives__. Who is gonna pay for the game? Who is gonna earn and how much?
__Adoption__. Until widely adopted Upala cannot be called an identity system. It needs a lot of businesses and a lot of users right from the start. How can we bring people in __even before__ there is an identity system? 


# Approach

__Do the research__. Be brave and stupid. Bring big and crazy ideas. Assemble, make it work on paper first. 
__Make it self-sustainable__. Money from an external source is influence. Make Upala self-sustainable. Generate enough income to keep good incetives for users and developers... But please please Petr stop selling your stuff and raise some funds for the research. 
__Chose the right game__. Make Upala properties quantitative! Provide human uniqueness __probability__ (the real, the mathematical one, eqaully measured by any independant outside odserver).
__Deliver in parts__. Split the system into meaningfull parts. Deliver as soon as there are outlines of an MVP.

# Progress

## Sybil attack protection
We've gone through some really abstract brainstorming to a soultion using dynamic proof of laction by FOAM (cool and shiny tech right from the future) and then to our Random handshakes anti-Sybil mechanism. See it below.

Currently we are exploring a trust-based approach. The first idea here is Bot market (see below).

It does matter who you are, where you are and who you friends with. We often use this as a metaphor to shape our thinking.

__Random handshakes (link)__

Every user has a global and a local reputation. Local means geographically local. Users earn local reputation when they meet each other in person in random pairs and confirm each other's "humannes". Face recognition algorithm detects sibyls.

Two cities establish a connection when their citizens travel. The more travelers the better. Global reputation is calculated by “routing” local user's reputation to the global level loosing points at connections with low bandwith. 

__Bot market (link)__

If we can't prove that bot is a bot, let's give bot owners what they want - a convenient bot market and bot management tools. This way we will know the number of bots and their cost.

Quality control layer for an anti-Sybil system. The idea is "pluggable" into any anti-Sybil mechanism. 


## Account recovery

Humbly scratching the surface. Nothing posted on this topic. Yet account recovery is the first candidate to be separated into independendt product.

## Incentives

__Heal for profit__

Users are rewarded with Reputation token for any action healing the system. Reputation can be converted into Interaction token. Services buy Interaction tokens and pay for identity information with it.

## Adoption 
Just keeping adoption in mind (adoption gap). If we deliver self-sustainable game in meaningfull parts this challange will be resolved.

##Andrei Bolkisev - Advisor, Economic models.

Andrei Bolkisev is an information systems engineer and programmer with 13 years of experience and Ph.D. in computational physics. As information systems engineer he was leading projects ranged from state-scaled information systems to microcontrollers programming. In computation physics, he worked on developing novel methods applied to combustion of solids modeling (structure of heterogeneous solids simulation and analysis, chemical kinetics models developing, solving of stiff PDE systems). As for now, he is most interested in investigating social and economic dynamics.
