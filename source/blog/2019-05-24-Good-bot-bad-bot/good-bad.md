There is this document on current state of the art Sybil attack protection in social networks (Thanks Adam for the document).

There is a classification of mechanisms. It looks like this. 

But there is no subclass of game based algorythms. This fact makes me even more confident in what we are doing. As we are trying to make something completely different.

I do believe we don't have to analyse everything. I believe there is a way to tokenize and gamify everything. So that the system will "analyse itself". Users will fight down bots. 

Another thing which makes me confident is that we are not building  a social network. We are building Sybil-defence system. This is our main purpose. We don't have to use some auxiliary methods to detect bots, based on behavior. We can progrm behavior. We don't have to analyse behavior. In an unobtrusive way. We are not affraid to introduce some additional Captcha mechanism. Because this is the sole purpose of the system - to tell human apart from bots. Hopefully we can even pay for it. 

So we need to introduce a form of a game. So that bots will lose. 

The simplest game I can imagine is to put those known algorithms on blockchain. Replace random walks with with token passing. I've made no calculation yet, but intuitevely it seems possible.

To give a short explanation. 

Here is a Good region and bot region. Our goal is to just pass good reputation among friends from some top level. Add up some rules. Like restrict a number of reputation flow through one connection. Make reputation spendable on interaction, so that a bot owner will be restricted in action + will have to make friends with a lot of people. 

This is nice but this system lacks punishment. 

There is no way to confirm a bot. There is no punishment for cooperating with a bot. 

Assume there is already a game which makes it hard for bots.

Friends add eachother. Earn reputation, form groups. 

So here is a game component that will solve both problems. Let's make a new policy: 

# Fake bot. 
Anyone can create a fake bot.
Fake bots are free and easy to create. They gain friends (fake friendship) and reputation from the start. Bots can be constructed the way it's creator wants. 
Fake bot can punish anyone who confirms friendship with it. 

- Educates people to add only real people
- Makes it possible to hunt for real bots (because they need more contacts).

Fake bot owners get rewarded for punishing people. 

Real bot owners get smarter. They will use social engineering to get more friends. So as fake bot owners.

This is like meta game. 


# Mark as bot
Less downside

# Slash a friend
Anyone can punish their friend. Steal and run. Friends have iterated game - they will not add a friend like that. Gossip will spread. 


Real bots need more friends to gain reputation. Real people will avoid them. But fake bots will
