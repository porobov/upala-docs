Sybil attack protection 

There needs to be a 


There are number of sybil-detection methods. But they all based on graph analysis. They all lack incentives. 

What method is the best is impossible to tell. All of them lack the wisdom of the crowd. They do the analysis. 

We have a luxury of utilizing real people knowledge and judgement. This is the way we would like to move. 

Let people decide who is real human. 
People already know it. We just need to honesty prevail malicious.

The neighbors of neighbors are very likely tobe neighbors, and any two nodes can typically be connected by arelatively short path. Watt and Strogatz referred to this as the smallworld phenomenon


# Self-analysing graph
Адаптировать известные алгоритмы выявления сибилов под токены. Вместо случайных проходов и выяснения пусть будет поток токенов. До кого они дошли, тот и человек. 

# Blade runners. A game theoretic approach to Sybil attack protection.

Alice spots a bot (an unknown person) among Bob's friends.

I know this person - give reputation
I don't know this person - get a reward sometime

Close friend (meet once a mounth)
Friend (meet once a year)


# Group responsibilty (разящий бот)

Anyone in a group can grab all the money. 
А вот боты наказаывать могут - пусть пользователи следят, кого они добавляют.
