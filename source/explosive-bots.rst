==============
EXPLOSIVE BOTS
==============
High-level incentives protocol (layer)

The game
========

The main idea of the game is the notion of explosive bots. 
Groups and explosive bots. With this we can construst an incetives to build a hierarchy. 
This is an incentives layer for other. 
The idea is to give quantitative assurance of personhood
Many network designs could be used. This is a standard to connect them all. 

Can create different systems. Even better it can be used to unite different systems into one. 

Moving game on chain



Entities
--------
Simple building block to build complex systems

Humans (or explosive bots)
--------------------------
Any account can cause damage to a group. 
Anyone can chose whether to gain reputation or to trade it for cash (and lose chance to enter those groups again). 

Groups

Bots train the network

Further work
============

Counting the bots
-----------------
The idea of explosive bots appeared first here (todo link to Bot black market). We hope to develop a system with some Zero Knowledge magic, able to count bots without revealing them. This most probaly will require to specify account type (bot or human) at creating once and forever. The actual implementation is to be discovered as well as its affect on the existing game. 

Standard, layer or protocol
---------------------------
How to position the system better. Should be a ERC20-like standard of smart contracts. A Uniswap-like contract factory or something different. 

System sustainability
---------------------
As of writing we believe the system will work without a specific token or any other point of centralization or income funnel. It looks like a standard for contracts. Unfortunately there is no reliable funding scheme in sight. So please consider donating right now (todo link)

Authorization commission
------------------------
The way a group can earn on authorization

Bot attack details
------------------
How exactly the bot reward is shared among the members of attack path

Privacy
