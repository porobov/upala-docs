Tasks
=====

Just left it here until I find a better soultion. 

Dragon quest:
-------------
- 3Box - https://explorer.bounties.network/bounty/3920
- Gnosis - https://explorer.bounties.network/bounty/3937
- Pepo UX - https://explorer.bounties.network/bounty/3922

General/UX
-----------
- Build UX based on figma.
- Done. Investigate group list storage on 3Box - call Rachel
- Done. Investigate Gnosis proxy for ID wallet - call Gnosis
- Done. Details of gnosis proxy - call Alen/Richard from Gnosis
- DApp UX

BladerunnerDAO:
---------------

- FakeMoloch and MetaCartel on Kovan (anyone can join by transaction)
- Minimal BladerunnerDAO (no admin)
- Interaction with DApp

Future:
- Create minimal UX for joinig the DAOs (for Kovan prototype only, as mainnet will use real DAOs)
- Create UX for DAO-members to govern the DAO (and elect Emergency admin)
- Create UX for BladerunnerDAO emergency admin
- Check if there is a mirror of DAOs on Kovan (or other testnets)


Friends-based dimension
-----------------------
- Groups creation UX 
- Group management UX (approve members, assign scores, etc...)
- Hard-coded top-level friends group (a factory, that creates and autoassigns scores to subgroups)
- DApp support for the score provider
- Telegram, Discord UX for creating groups

If we build friends based system, how a DApp will now about a new group
We will still need a BladerunnerDAO, but generating groups. 




Pepo-based dimension
--------------------
an anti-Sybil test based on existing Pepo features. 
- Have a call 


**Next, human, have a look at** :ref:`the Upala Universe (all the things you can build with Upala)<universe>`.
