**Andrei Bolkisev - Advisor (architecture).**

Andrei Bolkisev is an information systems engineer and programmer with 13 years of experience and Ph.D. in computational physics. As information systems engineer he was leading projects ranged from state-scaled information systems to microcontrollers programming. In computation physics, he worked on developing novel methods applied to combustion of solids modeling. As for now, he is most interested in investigating social and economic dynamics.

Tasks
=====

BladerunnerDAO (DAOs membership-based dimension):
-------------------------------------------------
Testnet:
- BladerunnerDAO smart contract(s)
- Mock Moloch and MetaCartel on Kovan (anyone can join by transaction)
- Entry tests smart contract(s)
- Front-end for users (Upala Wallet)
- Minimal BladerunnerDAO
- Front-end for BladerunnerDAO

Mainnet launch:
- Tests for front-ends
- Tests for contracts (Upala and Bladerunner)
- Upgradability for Upala protocol

Future:
- Create UX for DAO-members to govern the DAO (and elect Emergency admin)
- Create UX for BladerunnerDAO emergency admin
- Check if there is a mirror of DAOs on Kovan (or other testnets)


Friends-based dimension
-----------------------
- Groups creation UX 
- Group management UX (approve members, assign scores, etc...)
- Hard-coded top-level friends group (a factory, that creates and autoassigns scores to subgroups)
- DApp support for the score provider
- Telegram, Discord UX for creating groups

If we build friends based system, how a DApp will now about a new group
We will still need a BladerunnerDAO, but generating groups. 


Pepo-based dimension
--------------------
an anti-Sybil test based on existing Pepo features. 
- Have a call 


**Next, human, have a look at** :ref:`the Upala Universe (all the things you can build with Upala)<universe>`.
